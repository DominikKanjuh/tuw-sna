# Implied Role Mining

This project explores the process of **Implied Role Mining** using a dataset derived from the **Der Standard** newspaper platform. The dataset has undergone preprocessing and has been scaled to a uniform range of [-1, 1] to ensure consistency across all features. The primary objective is to identify and validate implied roles within the user data by analyzing behavior patterns, assigning roles based on predefined criteria and visualizing the relationships between roles and clusters.

Implied Role Mining involves defining user roles by leveraging platform functionalities and features, selecting key behavioral metrics and assigning roles based on conditions tailored to those features. Clustering techniques are then applied to validate the coherence of these roles by grouping users into clusters that reflect similar behavioral patterns.

The analysis employs hierarchical clustering using the Ward method. Visualization plays a critical role in this project, with the relationships between roles and clusters illustrated in both 2D and 3D PCA-reduced spaces.

This project was developed as part of the **Social Network Analysis(194.050)** course at TU Wien during the Winter 2024 semester. The work has been completed by Irene Garcia Villoria, JÃºlia Royes Royo, Roman Furzykov and Dominik Kanjuh.
